# Network-Design-IP-Subnetting-AUST-EEE

## Project: Design a Computer Network for Multimedia Communication in the EEE Department at AUST (Part 1)

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to design a reliable and efficient computer network for the Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) Department at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST). This network aims to support seamless multimedia communication, resource sharing, and internet connectivity for students and faculty.

### Project Phases:

1. **Network Planning and Requirements Gathering**  
   - Estimate network needs, such as user count, device type, and expected traffic.
   - Define goals and objectives for the network deployment.
   - Describe essential network services like internet connectivity, file sharing, and printing.
   - Prepare a requirements table with data gathered from literature, case studies, field surveys, and interviews.

2. **Network Design and Topology**  
   - Develop a network topology that aligns with the departmentâ€™s needs.
   - Create a logical layout of the network, showing the placement of routers, switches, access points, and servers.
   - Ensure scalability, redundancy, and segmentation for future growth.

3. **Selection of Networking Equipment and Cost Estimation**  
   - List appropriate networking equipment (routers, switches, access points, cables, etc.) based on network requirements.
   - Consider cost, performance, capacity, security, and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

4. **IP Addressing and Subnetting**  
   - Develop an IP addressing scheme with a suitable base IPv4 address and subnet mask.
   - Allocate IP addresses for different subnets (e.g., faculty, staff, students), using subnetting to allow future expansion.

5. **Network Device Configuration**  
   - Provide example configuration steps for client PCs, routers, switches, and access points, tailored to the network design.

6. **Documentation**  
   - Compile detailed documentation of network configurations, IP assignments, and device setups.
   - Include network diagrams, topologies, and the IP addressing scheme.
